title: Welcome to the attempt at an organized blog for my personal writings. 
description: This weekend someone wrote to me that they had a tramatic event.  The spent the night in the hospital with their mother, and he wrote to tell me he spent much of the night on my FB wall.  He was reading my musings from when my Dad fell ill and died.  I felt honored, but also a bit dismayed that he had to sort through all the rest of my life to get to what he needed.  I have wanted to do this for a long time - get organized around my thoguhts and writings.  Here is my attempt. DWC 9/26/20
